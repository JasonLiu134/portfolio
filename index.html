<h1>Jason Liu</h1>
<p>I'm Jason, and this is my portfolio. I'm currently learning and improving as a Data Scientist, and I'm excited to learn about data 
    visualizations in DSC 106 this quarter! My favorite color is Purple, Some of my hobbies outside of classes include gaming, cooking, 
    and drawing. In the future, I hope to be able to hone my skills in data science and conduct research on machine learning.
