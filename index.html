<h1>Jason Liu</h1>
<p>I'm Jason. I'm currently learning and improving as a Data Scientist, and I'm excited to learn about data visualizations in DSC 106 
    this quarter! My favorite color is Purple, Some of my hobbies outside of classes include gaming, cooking, and drawing. In the future,
    I hope to be able to hone my skills in data science and conduct research on machine learning.
